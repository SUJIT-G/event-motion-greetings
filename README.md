 üåü Features

-   **Multi-Event Themes:** Choose between different events (Birthday üéÇ, Wedding üíç) to completely change the look and feel.
-   **Dynamic Motion Backgrounds:** Each theme features a unique, lightweight, animated background (confetti for birthdays, bokeh for weddings).

-   **Fully Customizable:** Users can add the recipient's name, their name, and a custom message.
-   **Modern "Glassmorphism" UI:** The cards and inputs have a beautiful, blurry glass effect that looks premium.
-   **Responsive Design:** Looks and works great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **Web Share API:** Uses the native mobile sharing functionality for a seamless experience, with a "Copy Link" fallback for desktops.
